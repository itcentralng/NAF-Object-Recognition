            ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NAF PAY AND RECORDS GROUP
          </h3>
          <p class="text-100">
            At inception, the financial administration of the NAF was vested
            with the Nigerian Army.With the passage of time, the NAF became self
            accounting on Apr 72 and was headed by a chief PayMaster.With
            broader roles, growing manpower and expanded force structure
            witnessed in the early 1980s, the NAF PAy and Records was separated
            thereby giving birth to 2 independent establishments designed as the
            pay and Accounting Group and the personnel Management Group
            respectively.

            ABOLISHMENT OF TABLE PAYMENT IN THE NAF AND TRANSITION TO BANKING
            OPERATIONS
          </h3>
          <p class="text-100">
            Before the 1980s NAF personnel were paid salaries,allowances and
            other entitlements in cash via table payment.The process required a
            lot of manual actions such as physical cash handling that was slow
            and largely inaccurate.With the evolution of banking system and
            operation in Nigeria, the NAF Finance Corps at the time pushed for
            the abolishments of the table payment method and began to make
            payments to individual salary accounts of personnel through
            banks.This change brought about ease for Naf personnel and also
            improved efficiency and accountability.

              Prior to computerization, binders were used for computaion of
              salaries and allowances in PAG. This required manual entries,
              manual computaions and manual deductions of charges. A system
              called ACROL was used to generate and print salary schedules. Each
              page of

              he schedule had particulars of only 25 NAF personnel which were
              printed from the Machine Room in PAG. The NAF leveraged the
              computer revolution and computerized the salary payment processes
              in phases. As directed by HQ NAF, PAG subscribed to a programme
              named dBase III which was first used to process salaries of
              officers only. Subsequently, more efficient systems were developed
