With the passage of time, the NAF became self accounting on Apr 72 and was headed by a chief PayMaster. With broader roles, growing manpower and expanded force structure witnessed in the early 1980s, the NAF Pay and Records was separated thereby giving birth to 2 independent establishments designed as the Pay and Accounting Group and the Personnel Management Group respectively.",
