Each page of the schedule had particulars of only 25 NAF personnel which were printed from the Machine Room in PAG. The NAF leveraged the computer revolution and computerized the salary payment processes in phases. As directed by HQ NAF, PAG subscribed to a programme named dBase III which was first used to process salaries of officers only. Subsequently, more efficient systems were developed leading to the NAF subscribing to a more efficient and flexible software solution called \"Soja Pay\". The system features include payroll processing, reports, summaries and data management. The system also provided a training opportunity for personnel on specialized systems training.",
