With the passage of time, the NAF became self accounting on Apr 72 and was headed by a chief PayMaster. With broader roles, growing manpower and expanded force structure witnessed in the early 1980s, the NAF Pay and Records was separated thereby giving birth to 2 independent establishments designed as the Pay and Accounting Group and the Personnel Management Group respectively.",

The process required a lot of manual actions such as physical cash handling that was slow and largely inaccurate. With the evolution of banking system and operation in Nigeria, the NAF Finance Corps at the time pushed for the abolishment of the table payment method and began to make payments to individual salary accounts of personnel through banks. This change brought about ease for NAF personnel and also improved efficiency and accountability.",
